# STM-NFC

## Requirements:

Send a command "set led" from ACR1252U to STM32 using NFC click.

## Introduction:

Contactless near-field communication (NFC) technology allows data sharing between devices without physical contact. In this document, I'll explain how to send a "set led" command from an ACR1252U USB NFC reader to an STM32 microcontroller using an NFC click.

## Hardware Requirements:

- ACR1252U USB NFC reader
- NFC click PN7120
- STM32 Nucleo-32 microcontroller

## Software Requirements:

- STM32 Cube IDE
- ACS NFC Reader Tool

## Explain Hardware Connection

To connect the NFC click the PN7120 module to the STM Nucleo-32 board, and follow these steps:

1. Connect the NFC click module to the Arduino-compatible headers on the STM Nucleo-32 board.

2. Connect the ACR1252U USB NFC Reader to your computer using a USB cable.

## Conclusion

In this document, I have added the steps per your requirements and hope you find them helpful.

The document explores how to share data using NFC between an ACR1252U USB NFC Reader and an STM Nucleo-32 board. I have also included the hardware and software requirements for this project.
